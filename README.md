# OPT
Github der Operation Pandora Trigger

## Future structure
I would like to divide the components into core and additional so that we have a clearer separation of what is only nice to have and what has to be loaded in all cases

- src
  - core
  - additional
- doc
- assets

of course all the standard files like mission.sqm and description.ext have to be on the root level as usual
